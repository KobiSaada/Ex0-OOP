In this project I developed an infrastructure of data structure, algorithms and a display system of unweighted and unintentional graph built from
three departments that implement the interfaces of the three departments are:
 1) a vertex in which this department can have all the information about a vertex Graph An algorithm in which all the algorithms of a graph are implemented.
 2) a graph which is everything
 3) Graph An algorithm in which all the algorithms of a graph are implemented.
   After selecting the data structure I will implement a number of algorithms which are then on the graph including the ability to duplicate, check bindings, calculate a short path and find the short path and more ..

 I chose the HashMap data structure because it is built so that each value has its own key what is required in the graph that each vertex is unique with its values ​​and also because the average run times of operations in this structure are (O (1)).
 And it helped me a lot in realizing the graph department.

 In the Graph Algorithms Department, I used the Bfs and Dfs algorithms(O(v+E) that I learned from the Internet, which can be used to go through a graph and help me solve the class' implementation solution.

 My personal experience from this task is terribly satisfying and I learned a lot.l experience from this task is terribly satisfying and I learned a lot.
